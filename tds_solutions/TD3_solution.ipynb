    "**(a)** Let's compute the characteristic polynomial: $$p_A(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\det(\\begin{pmatrix}1 - \\lambda & 4 \\\\ 2 & 3 - \\lambda\\end{pmatrix} = (1 - \\lambda)(3 - \\lambda) - 8 = \\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda - 5 = (\\lambda - 5)(\\lambda + 1).$$  This has roots at $\\boxed{\\lambda = 5}$ and $\\boxed{\\lambda = -1}$, so these are the eigenvalues.  To find an eigenvector with eigenvalue 5, we need to find a nonzero vector $(x, y)$ such that $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} x & y\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x + 4y \\\\ 2x + 3y\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5x \\\\ 5y\\end{pmatrix}.$$  Eyeballing it, we see that $\\boxed{(1, 1) \\text{ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 5}}$ (and so is any nonzero multiple of it).   We could also compute this more \"mechanically\" by finding the nullspace of $A-5I = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 4 \\\\ 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, but the nullspace vector (the eigenvector!) $(1,1)$ is even more obvious from this matrix.  For eigenvalue -1, we need to find some nonzero $(x, y)$ such that $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} x & y\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x + 4y \\\\ 2x + 3y\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x \\\\ -y\\end{pmatrix}.$$  Eyeballing it, we see that $\\boxed{(-2, 1) \\text{ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1}}$ (and so is any nonzero multiple of it).  Again, the more systematic procedure is to find $N(A+I)$, but since $A+I = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$ the nullspace vector $(-2, 1)$ should be obvious.\n",

    "For $A+2I$, the characteristic polynomial is $(3-\\lambda)(5-\\lambda) - 8 = \\lambda^2 - 8\\lambda + 7 = (\\lambda - 7) (\\lambda - 1)$.   So the eigenvalues are **λ=7** and **λ=1**: the old eigenvalues **plus 2**.   If we find the eigenvectors, they are the **same** as before, since they are the nullspaces of $A+2I-7I=A-5I$ and $A+2I-I=A+I$, the same as above!\n",

    "**(b)** If $Ax = \\lambda x$ then $(A + \\alpha I)x = Ax + \\alpha Ix = \\lambda x + \\alpha x = \\boxed{(\\lambda + \\alpha)x}$.   That is **A+αI has the same eigenvectors as A**, and the eigenvalues λ of A become **eigenvalues λ+α of A+αI**. This agrees with part (a), taking $\\alpha = 2$ (we have 7=5+2 and 1=–1+2)."

Acting on the other eigenvector, it gives a multiple of that eigenvector, so $x_2$ must span the 1d column space exactly as above.\n",

Multiplying by $A$, we get $AA^TAv = A\\lambda v$, so that $(AA^T)(Av) = \\lambda(Av).$  So, as long as $\\lambda Av \\neq 0$, then this means that $\\boxed{Av}$ is also an eigenvector of $AA^T$.  So when is $\\lambda Av \\neq 0$?  Well, we need both that $\\lambda \\neq 0$ and that $Av \\neq 0$.  But in fact the latter follows from the former.  Indeed, if $\\lambda \\neq 0$, then that $v$ is an eigenvector of $A^TA$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ means that $A^TAv = \\lambda v \\neq 0$, so $v$ is not in the nullspace of $A^TA$.  But $N(A^TA) = N(A)$, as we showed earlier in the course, so also $v$ is not in the nullspace of $A$, so $Av \\neq 0$.  So the second ...... is supposed to be $\\boxed{\\text{zero}}$."
