    "Recall that the process of [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) involves subtracting rows to turn a matrix $A$ into an [upper triangular matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix) $U$.  Often we *augment* the matrix with an additional column, representing the right-hand side $b$ of a system of equations $Ax=b$ that we want to solve: by doing the same row operations to both $A$ and $b$, we arrive at an equivalent equation $Ux=c$ that is easy to solve by *backsubstitution* (solving for one variable at a time, working from the last row to the top row).\n",
