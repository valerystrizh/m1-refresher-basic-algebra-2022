We can find symmetric matrices $A$ and $B$ that don't commute pretty easily, for example using our knowledge of row/column operations.  Remember that row operations are achieved by left multiplications, and column operations by right multiplications.  So, if we take $A$ to be the symmetric permutation matrix $$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$$ then $AB$ will be $B$ with its rows swapped, and $BA$ will be $B$ with its columns swapped.

Indeed, if $X$ is any square matrix, we can write $$X = \\frac{X + X^T}{2} + \\frac{X - X^T}{2}$$ and the first term is symmetric (by two bullet points up) and the second term is anti-symmetric (by one bullet point up).  The uniqueness can be seen like this.  Suppose $X = Y + Z = Y' + Z'$ where $Y, Y'$ are symmetric and $Z, Z'$ are antisymmetric.  Then $Y - Y' = Z - Z'$.  But as $Y, Y'$ are symmetric, so is $Y - Y'$.  As $Z, Z'$ are antisymmetric, so is $Z - Z'$.  But $Y - Y'$ and $Z - Z'$ are equal, and the only matrix that is simultaneously symmetric and antisymmetric is the 0 matrix; so $Y - Y' = Z - Z' = 0$, so $Y = Y$ and $Z = Z'$ and the decompositions $X = Y + Z = Y' + Z'$ were the same to begin with!  As a final note, if we think of a $m \\times m$ matrix as a vector of length $m^2$, then any symmetric matrix is orthogonal to any antisymmetric matrix (why?), so the above actually shows that the *subspaces* of symmetric and anti-symmetric matrices are orthogonal complements of one another."
