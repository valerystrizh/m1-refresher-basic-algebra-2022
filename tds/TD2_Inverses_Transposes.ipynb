    "The idea is to just take the transpose in each case and see what you get.  If you get the same thing, the matrix in question was symmetric.  If you don't get the same form, you can usually see why, and you can then cook up some choices of the matrices that really show the result doesn't have to be symmetric.\n",

    "* $A^2 - B^2$: MUST be symmetric. Taking transposes, we get $$(A^2 - B^2)^T = (AA)^T - (BA)^T = A^TA^T - B^TB^T = A^2 - B^2$$\n",
    "* $(A+B)(A-B)$: DOES NOT need to be symmetric.  First, multiplying out the expression we get $(A^2 - B^2) + (BA - AB)$.  This *does not have to equal* $A^2 - B^2$ because it's possible that $AB \\neq BA$ (i.e. when $A$ and $B$ don't *commute*.  Taking the transpose gives: $$(A^2 - B^2)^T + (BA - AB)^T = A^2 - B^2 - A^TB^T - B^TAT^ = A^2 - B^2 - (BA - AB).$$  So, we see that $(A + B)(A - B)$ is symmetric if and only if $BA - AB = AB - BA$, i.e. if and only if $AB = BA$, i.e when $A$ and $B$ commute.  We can find symmetric matrices $A$ and $B$ that don't commute pretty easily, for example using our knowledge of row/column operations.  Remember that row operations are achieved by left multiplications, and column operations by right multiplications.  So, if we take $A$ to be the symmetric permutation matrix $$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$$ then $AB$ will be $B$ with its rows swapped, and $BA$ will be $B$ with its columns swapped.  So, choosing $B$ to be a symmetric matrix that looks different if we swap its rows or columns, for example $$B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix}$$ we get a concrete counterexample.\n",

So any non-symmetric $C$ will give a counterexample.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Remark** A matrix $X$ that satisfies $X^T = -X$ is called *antisymmetric*.  It's a basic fact that any matrix can be written uniquely as a sum of a symmetric matrix with an antisymmetric matrix.  Indeed, if $X$ is any square matrix, we can write $$X = \\frac{X + X^T}{2} + \\frac{X - X^T}{2}$$ and the first term is symmetric (by two bullet points up) and the second term is anti-symmetric (by one bullet point up).  The uniqueness can be seen like this.  Suppose $X = Y + Z = Y' + Z'$ where $Y, Y'$ are symmetric and $Z, Z'$ are antisymmetric.  Then $Y - Y' = Z - Z'$.  But as $Y, Y'$ are symmetric, so is $Y - Y'$.  As $Z, Z'$ are antisymmetric, so is $Z - Z'$.  But $Y - Y'$ and $Z - Z'$ are equal, and the only matrix that is simultaneously symmetric and antisymmetric is the 0 matrix; so $Y - Y' = Z - Z' = 0$, so $Y = Y$ and $Z = Z'$ and the decompositions $X = Y + Z = Y' + Z'$ were the same to begin with!  As a final note, if we think of a $m \\times m$ matrix as a vector of length $m^2$, then any symmetric matrix is orthogonal to any antisymmetric matrix (why?), so the above actually shows that the *subspaces* of symmetric and anti-symmetric matrices are orthogonal complements of one another.\n",

    "* $ABAB$ DOES NOT need to be symmetric.  Taking transposes, we get $$(ABAB)^T = B^TA^TB^TA^T = BABA$$ so for $ABAB$ to by symmetric means that $ABAB = BABA$.  We can cook up a counterexample using a similar strategy to what we did in the $(A - B)(A + B)$ problem.  In particular, let's just choose some random matrices $A, B$ that are symmetric; they probably won't commute very well, and so $ABAB$ and $BABA$ should be different."
